Tested up to: 4.4
Stable tag: 0.4.7

Dropdown box on a line under the Pages subitem of the Pages menu in Admin to directly edit page.
Pushes Pages up above Posts with JS.

== Description ==

This plugin does 2 related things that improve the experience using WordPress as a CMS:

1. Moves the Pages menu above Posts.

2. Adds a hierarchical popup menu of pages that you can use to jump right into that particular page.

This makes it much quicker when you're jumping between static pages.

We reorder items with JavaScript (so it shouldn't break anything else, but you may notice a little jump after the page loads). The popup menu is created with PHP.

== Installation ==

1. Install using the WordPress Plugins Repository installer or upload the _quick-edit-pages_ folder to your _wp-content/plugins/_ directory.
2. Activate the plug-in.
3. Notice the Pages section is now at the top of the management menu and it has a nice popup menu with all the pages in it.

== Usage ==
Choose a page from the menu and you'll be taken straight to the editor.

== Screenshots ==
1. The popup menu appears under the page section.
2. Notice how the **Pages** menu is now before **Posts**. Choose a page from the menu to go directly to editing it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Can I change any options? <br /> Not yet.

2. Can I give you suggestions? <br /> Yes. Email me at **wordpress_at_m.rowbory.co.uk**
